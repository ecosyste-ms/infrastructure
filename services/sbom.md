**URL**: https://sbom.ecosyste.ms  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/ecosyste-ms/sbom  
**Server**: 195.154.82.7 (Large, shared)  
**Performance Period**: July 24 - August 23, 2025 (30 days)

## Performance Summary

- **Total Requests**: No web traffic detected (30 days)
- **Background Jobs**: No background jobs detected (30 days)
- **Uptime**: No uptime monitoring errors detected
- **Open Incidents**: 0 currently open

## Endpoint Analysis

### No Web Traffic Detected
- **No transaction_duration data found** for the 30-day period
- **No endpoint activity recorded** in AppSignal monitoring
- **Service may be**:
  - Not actively used during monitoring period
  - Recently deployed with minimal usage
  - Experiencing configuration issues preventing traffic logging
  - In development/testing phase

## Critical Issues

### ª **NO ACTIVITY DETECTED**
- **No web requests recorded** over 30-day monitoring period
- **No background job activity** detected
- **No application incidents** reported
- **Service status unclear**: May be inactive, unused, or misconfigured

### **Potential Causes**
1. **Service not actively used**: SBOM functionality may not be in demand yet
2. **Recent deployment**: Service may be newly created with minimal adoption
3. **Configuration issues**: Traffic may not be properly routed or monitored
4. **Development status**: Service may still be in development phase

## Performance Characteristics

### ª **INACTIVE OR NEWLY DEPLOYED SERVICE**
- **Zero activity**: No measurable traffic or background processing
- **SBOM focus**: Software Bill of Materials analysis service
- **Specialized functionality**: Likely serves specific security/compliance use cases
- **AppSignal monitoring active**: Service is connected to monitoring but shows no usage

### **Expected Usage Pattern** (When Active)
- **Security-focused**: SBOM analysis for software supply chain security
- **Compliance-driven**: Regulatory and compliance reporting
- **Integration-heavy**: Likely API-focused for toolchain integration
- **Analysis-intensive**: Background processing for SBOM generation and analysis

## Server Infrastructure

**Server Details**:
- **IP**: 195.154.82.7
- **Type**: Large server (shared with 17 other services)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- **Shared Services**: Part of successful 18-service consolidation

**Resource Utilization**:
- **No resource usage**: Zero traffic requires no server resources
- **Perfect sharing candidate**: Ideal for shared server with no current load
- **System metrics available**: AppSignal shows infrastructure metrics but no application activity

## Background Jobs Analysis

- **Total Background Jobs**: None detected
- **Expected functionality**: SBOM generation would typically require background processing
- **Service architecture**: Likely designed for asynchronous SBOM analysis
- **Current status**: No job processing activity recorded

## Action Items

### = **INVESTIGATION REQUIRED**
1. **Service status verification** - confirm if SBOM service is intended to be active
2. **Traffic routing check** - verify if requests are properly reaching the service
3. **Configuration review** - ensure AppSignal monitoring is properly configured
4. **Deployment status** - confirm if service is fully deployed and accessible

### =Ê **SERVICE ACTIVATION (If Intended to be Active)**
1. **Feature promotion** - communicate SBOM service availability to users
2. **Integration documentation** - provide API documentation for SBOM integration
3. **Usage examples** - create tutorials and examples for SBOM functionality
4. **Monitoring verification** - ensure traffic logging is working correctly

### =à **DEVELOPMENT COMPLETION (If Still in Development)**
1. **Development roadmap** - establish timeline for SBOM service completion
2. **Feature planning** - define SBOM functionality and use cases
3. **Integration design** - plan how SBOM service integrates with ecosystem
4. **Testing strategy** - develop testing approach for SBOM functionality

### =È **MONITORING SETUP**
1. **Health check implementation** - add basic health/status endpoints
2. **Usage tracking** - implement metrics for SBOM generation and analysis
3. **Performance monitoring** - track SBOM processing times and success rates
4. **Error monitoring** - ensure proper error reporting for SBOM operations

## Technical Notes

**Service Purpose**:
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**: Security and compliance analysis service
- **Supply chain security**: Tracks software dependencies and vulnerabilities
- **Compliance reporting**: Supports regulatory requirements for software transparency
- **Integration service**: Likely provides SBOM data to other ecosystem services

**Expected Architecture** (Based on Purpose):
- **Background-heavy**: SBOM generation requires intensive processing
- **API-first**: Integration with security tools and compliance systems
- **Data-intensive**: Processing dependency trees and vulnerability databases
- **Security-focused**: Handling sensitive security and compliance data

**Infrastructure Readiness**:
- **AppSignal connected**: Monitoring infrastructure is in place
- **Shared server**: Appropriate infrastructure allocation for new service
- **System resources available**: Can scale up if service becomes active

## Recommendations

**Status**: ª **INACTIVE/INVESTIGATION REQUIRED** - Service shows no activity over 30-day period despite being connected to monitoring infrastructure.

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **CLARIFY**: Determine intended status of SBOM service (active, development, future)
2. **VERIFY**: Check if service is properly configured and accessible
3. **INVESTIGATE**: Confirm traffic routing and monitoring setup
4. **DOCUMENT**: Record current service status and future plans

**If Service Should Be Active**:
1. **Troubleshoot**: Investigate why no traffic is reaching the service
2. **Promote**: Communicate SBOM functionality availability to users
3. **Document**: Create integration guides and API documentation
4. **Monitor**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for SBOM operations

**If Service Is In Development**:
1. **Plan**: Establish development timeline and feature requirements
2. **Design**: Define SBOM service architecture and integrations
3. **Prepare**: Set up proper development and testing environments
4. **Communicate**: Update stakeholders on SBOM service progress

**Role in Ecosystem**: SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) services are increasingly important for software supply chain security and regulatory compliance. If properly implemented, this service could provide valuable security insights and compliance reporting for the Ecosyste.ms platform.

The lack of activity suggests either the service is not yet ready for production use or there may be configuration issues preventing proper operation. Investigation is needed to determine the intended status and resolve any issues blocking service utilization.
