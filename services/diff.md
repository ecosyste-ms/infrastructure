# Diff Service

**URL**: https://diff.ecosyste.ms  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/ecosyste-ms/diff  
**Server**: 195.154.82.7 (Large, shared)  
**Performance Period**: July 24 - August 23, 2025 (30 days)

## Performance Summary

- **Total Requests**: 0.2M web requests (30 days)
- **Background Jobs**: None detected
- **Uptime**: 88.40% (669 uptime monitor errors)
- **Error Rate**: Unknown (no error data available)
- **Open Incidents**: 0 currently open

## Endpoint Analysis

### Web Endpoints (by request volume)

1. **JobsController#diff** - 142,508 requests (76.4%)
   - Primary diff comparison functionality
   - Core service feature

2. **HomeController#index** - 43,965 requests (23.6%)
   - Home page and service information
   - Landing page traffic

### Simple Service Architecture
- **Only 2 active endpoints** detected
- **Focused functionality**: Diff comparison service
- **Low overall traffic**: 186K total requests over 30 days

## Performance Characteristics

###   **Low Traffic with Uptime Issues**
- **Very low traffic**: Only 0.2M requests over 30 days
- **Uptime problems**: 88.40% (below 99% threshold)
- **669 uptime monitor errors** indicate reliability issues
- **No error rate data**: Suggests either very low errors or reporting issues

### **Service Usage**
- **Specialized tool**: Diff comparison functionality
- **Limited scope**: Simple two-endpoint service
- **On-demand usage**: Likely used for specific diff operations

## Server Infrastructure

**Server Details**:
- **IP**: 195.154.82.7
- **Type**: Large server (shared with 17 other services)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- **Shared Services**: Part of 18-service consolidation

**Resource Context**:
- **Well-shared server**: Other services on same server perform well
- **Low resource usage**: 0.2M requests unlikely to strain server
- **Uptime issues**: Likely service-specific, not server-wide

## Background Jobs

- **No background job activity detected**
- Service appears to be purely request-driven for diff operations

## Action Items

###   **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Uptime Issues**
1. **Investigate uptime problems** - 88.40% needs improvement to >99%
2. **Analyze 669 monitoring errors** - identify patterns and root causes
3. **Service stability review** - check application logs for failures
4. **Resource monitoring** - ensure service isn't running out of memory/resources

### = **INVESTIGATION REQUIRED**
1. **Error reporting verification** - confirm why no error rate data is available
2. **Service usage analysis** - determine if low traffic is expected
3. **Diff operation performance** - analyze JobsController#diff response times
4. **Health monitoring** - implement better service health checks

### =Ê **MONITORING IMPROVEMENTS**
1. **Enhanced error tracking** - ensure all errors are properly reported
2. **Uptime alerting** - set up alerts for service availability
3. **Performance baselines** - establish response time expectations
4. **Usage analytics** - track diff operation success rates

### =' **SERVICE OPTIMIZATION**
1. **Diff operation efficiency** - optimize core diff functionality
2. **Caching strategy** - consider caching for repeated diff requests
3. **Resource allocation** - ensure adequate resources for diff operations
4. **Error handling** - improve error reporting and user feedback

## Technical Notes

**Service Purpose**:
- **Code diff analysis**: Provides diff comparison functionality
- **Simple architecture**: Two-endpoint service focused on specific task
- **Integration service**: Likely used by other Ecosyste.ms services

**Performance Profile**:
- **Low volume, specialized use**: 0.2M requests for specific functionality
- **Reliability concerns**: Uptime issues need addressing
- **Resource efficient**: Minimal server resource usage

**Usage Patterns**:
- **On-demand service**: Used when diff analysis is needed
- **Integration endpoint**: JobsController#diff likely serves other services
- **Informational landing**: Home page for service information

## Recommendations

**Status**:   **STABLE but Needs Uptime Improvement** - Service is functionally working but has reliability issues that need addressing.

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Priority**: Improve uptime from 88.40% to >99%
2. **Investigate**: Root cause of 669 uptime monitoring errors
3. **Monitor**: Establish better error reporting and service monitoring
4. **Optimize**: Diff operation performance and reliability

**Next Steps**: Focus on uptime investigation and reliability improvements while maintaining current functionality. The low traffic volume suggests this is a specialized service that works well when available but needs better reliability.
