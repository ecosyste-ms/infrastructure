# Dashboard Service

**URL**: https://dashboard.ecosyste.ms  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/ecosyste-ms/dashboard  
**Server**: 195.154.82.7 (Large, shared)  
**Performance Period**: July 24 - August 23, 2025 (30 days)

## Performance Summary

- **Total Requests**: No data available
- **Background Jobs**: No data available
- **Uptime**: Unknown (no uptime monitoring errors detected)
- **Error Rate**: Unknown
- **Open Incidents**: Unable to determine

## Critical Issue: No AppSignal Data

### =4 **AppSignal Integration Problem**
The Dashboard service is **not reporting any metrics to AppSignal**, despite being listed as an available application. This indicates a fundamental monitoring issue.

**Possible Causes**:
1. **AppSignal gem not configured** - Missing or misconfigured integration
2. **Service not running** - Application may be down or not deployed
3. **Network connectivity** - Unable to reach AppSignal servers
4. **Configuration mismatch** - Wrong environment or API key settings
5. **Recent deployment issue** - Service may have been recently broken

## Server Infrastructure

**Server Details**:
- **IP**: 195.154.82.7
- **Type**: Large server (shared with 17 other services)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- **Shared Services**: Part of successful 18-service consolidation

**Infrastructure Status**: Server is healthy - other services on same server are functioning well.

## Service Status Assessment

### =4 **UNKNOWN STATUS**
Without metrics data, we cannot assess:
- Traffic volumes
- Error rates
- Performance characteristics  
- Background job processing
- Database connectivity
- API endpoint health

## Action Items

### =¨ **IMMEDIATE (Critical)**
1. **Service health check** - Verify if dashboard.ecosyste.ms is accessible
2. **Application logs review** - Check server logs for application startup/runtime errors
3. **AppSignal integration check** - Verify gem installation and configuration
4. **Process monitoring** - Confirm application processes are running
5. **Database connectivity** - Test database connections and migrations

### =4 **HIGH PRIORITY**
1. **Deployment verification** - Ensure latest code is properly deployed
2. **Environment configuration** - Verify all environment variables are set
3. **Dependency check** - Ensure all required services/databases are available
4. **SSL/DNS verification** - Confirm domain and certificate are working
5. **Load balancer health** - Check if service is receiving traffic

###   **MEDIUM PRIORITY**  
1. **Monitoring setup** - Implement comprehensive application monitoring
2. **Health check endpoint** - Add `/health` endpoint for service verification
3. **Error tracking** - Set up error reporting and alerting
4. **Performance baseline** - Establish metrics once service is restored

### =Ê **MONITORING SETUP**
1. **AppSignal integration** - Fix metrics reporting
2. **Uptime monitoring** - Add external service monitoring
3. **Log aggregation** - Centralize application logs
4. **Alert configuration** - Set up incident response alerts

## Technical Investigation Required

### **Immediate Checks**
1. **Service accessibility**: `curl https://dashboard.ecosyste.ms`
2. **Process status**: `ps aux | grep dashboard`
3. **Application logs**: Check Rails/application logs for errors
4. **Database connection**: Verify database connectivity
5. **AppSignal config**: Check `config/appsignal.yml` and environment variables

### **Configuration Verification**
1. **Environment variables**: Check APPSIGNAL_PUSH_API_KEY and other settings
2. **Gem installation**: Verify `appsignal` gem is in Gemfile and bundle
3. **Initializer**: Check AppSignal initializer configuration
4. **Environment**: Confirm RAILS_ENV=production or appropriate environment

## Notes

The Dashboard service represents a **critical monitoring gap** in the infrastructure. As a dashboard service, it likely provides important visibility into other services, making its restoration a high priority.

**Status**: =4 **SERVICE DOWN OR MISCONFIGURED** - Requires immediate investigation and resolution. Without basic metrics, the service is effectively invisible to monitoring and may not be serving users.

## Recommendations

1. **Emergency response**: Treat as potential service outage
2. **Full service audit**: Check all aspects from deployment to configuration
3. **Monitoring restoration**: Priority focus on getting metrics reporting working
4. **Documentation**: Document resolution steps for future reference

**Next Steps**: Manual investigation required to determine actual service status and restore monitoring capabilities.
