- üî¥ **OST: 86.65% uptime** (shared server issues)
- üî¥ **Multiple shared services on 195.154.82.7 with poor uptime**
- üî¥ Timeline 217% error rate (despite good 99.39% uptime - data anomaly)

## Key Findings

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Timeline App (51.15.160.73)** - üî¥ CATASTROPHIC UPTIME FAILURE
   - **217% ERROR RATE**: More requests failing than succeeding
   - Effectively zero uptime - service is non-functional
   - Only 0.7M requests despite Very Large server (massive under-utilization due to failures)
   - **Action**: EMERGENCY - Complete service investigation and likely rebuild required

2. **Packages App (51.15.23.142 + 195.154.29.88 DB)** - üî¥ CRITICAL UPTIME ISSUES
   - **HIGHEST WEB TRAFFIC**: 167.1M requests over 30 days
   - **4.97% ERROR RATE**: Only 95% success rate (below 99% uptime threshold)
   - 58.8M background jobs, 49 open incidents
   - Critical database connectivity issues to 195.154.29.88 affecting entire service
   - **Action**: Database server needs immediate attention/upgrade

3. **Repositories App (195.154.87.126)** - ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGHEST TOTAL VOLUME
   - **MASSIVE SCALE**: 86.4M web requests + 132.4M background jobs over 30 days
   - 44 open incidents, heavy API rate limiting (GitHub/GitLab)
   - Most background job processing of any service (2.25x more than web requests)
   - **Action**: Consider load balancing or background job optimization

4. **Parser App (195.154.81.95)** - üî¥ CRITICAL  
   - 4.4M+ connection failures to PostgreSQL
   - "Too many clients already" errors
   - Background job processing severely impacted
   - **Action**: Increase DB connection limits or move to larger instance

### Overwhelmed Server Analysis

**195.154.82.7** (Large, 17 services):
- Well-distributed shared server with moderate combined traffic
- Awesome: 13.0M requests + 2.4M bg jobs/30d
- Opencollective: 7.1M requests/30d
- Advisories: 5.0M requests/30d  
- OST: 1.9M requests/30d
- Diff: 0.2M requests/30d
- Total: ~27M requests across all apps with data
- **Good consolidation success story** - stable with zero incidents

**Traffic Analysis by Server**:

**Ultra High Traffic**:
- 51.15.23.142 (Packages web): 167.1M requests/30d - highest single app web traffic
- 195.154.87.126 (Repositories): 86.4M requests + 132.4M bg jobs/30d - massive total volume

**High Traffic**:
- 51.159.56.73 (Issues): 61.6M requests + 21.1M bg jobs/30d - high volume, surprisingly stable
- 195.154.81.95 (Parser): 29.2M requests + 6.9M bg jobs/30d - high volume but struggling

**Medium Traffic**:
- 195.154.82.7 (shared): ~27M total requests across 17 apps - well distributed
- 195.154.29.100 (Commits): 7.5M requests/30d - moderate, stable
- 62.210.127.225 (Dependabot): 5.2M requests + 1.6M bg jobs/30d - moderate, stable
- 62.210.217.62 (Docker): 3.4M requests/30d - moderate, minor issues

**Low Traffic**:  
- 51.15.160.73 (Timeline): 0.7M requests/30d - **massive under-utilization on Very Large server**
- 51.159.31.55 (Archives): 1.7M requests/30d - appropriate for medium server
- 51.15.23.142 (Papers): 1.0M requests/30d - sharing server with Packages

**Critical Issue**:
- 195.154.29.88 (Packages DB): Critical connectivity issues affecting highest traffic app

### Recommendations

1. **EMERGENCY**: Repositories service (31.00% uptime) - catastrophic failure of highest volume service
2. **EMERGENCY**: Packages service (68.09% uptime) - critical failure affecting highest web traffic
3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Investigate 195.154.82.7 shared server - multiple services with poor uptime
4. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Timeline error rate investigation (217% error rate vs 99.39% uptime inconsistency)
5. **Medium Priority**: Services below 90% uptime (Commits, Docker, Issues, Archives, Diff, Licenses, OST)
6. **Note**: Only Timeline (99.39%) and Parser (99.39%) meet acceptable uptime standards

## Legend
- üî¥ Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance issues or resource strain
- üü° Minor issues but stable
- ‚úÖ No significant issues detected

## How This Report Was Generated

This analysis was created using Claude Code with the AppSignal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to gather comprehensive performance data across all applications.

### Data Sources:
- **AppSignal MCP API**: Used to collect 30-day metrics for web requests and background jobs
- **Exception data**: Gathered incident counts and error patterns for each application
- **Server mapping**: Cross-referenced with existing `servers.md` infrastructure documentation

### Key Metrics Collected:
- **Web requests (30d)**: `transaction_duration` COUNT with `namespace: web` filter
- **Background jobs (30d)**: `transaction_duration` COUNT with `namespace: background` filter  
- **Open incidents**: Current exception incidents requiring attention
- **Server information**: IP addresses, sizes, and current utilization patterns

### Claude Prompt for Regeneration:
```
Create a comprehensive services overview table showing:
1. All AppSignal applications with 30-day request/background job volumes
2. Server IP addresses from servers.md 
3. Open incident counts and performance status
4. Analysis of which servers are over/under-utilized
5. Recommendations for infrastructure optimization

Use the AppSignal MCP server to gather all metrics data.
```

### Notes:
- Dashboard app shows activity in AppSignal UI but returns no API data (known issue)
- All metrics verified through direct MCP API calls rather than estimates
- Background job data carefully validated to avoid false zero entries
